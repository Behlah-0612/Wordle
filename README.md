Wordle Game in C
This program is a custom implementation of the popular Wordle game, written in C using CS50's library. The game allows the user to guess a secret word of a length between 5 and 8 letters, which the user selects at the start. The goal is to guess the word within 5 attempts.

For each guess:

Green indicates the correct letter in the correct position.

Yellow indicates the correct letter in the wrong position.

Red indicates an incorrect letter.

The game ends when the user guesses the word correctly or exhausts all 5 attempts. The program runs entirely in the terminal, providing an interactive experience with dynamic color-coded feedback.
